# Hi there! 👋

I’m **Siddhesh**, an enthusiastic coder who loves solving problems and building innovative solutions.


### My Journey 🚀

- My journey into tech began when I tried to dual boot my laptop to Ubuntu. It was a rollercoaster of excitement (`If Dead screen with GRUB interface when you have made ubuntu your primary OS but also deleted the ubuntu OS from windows means excitement`) and learning, but successfully navigating that process ignited my passion for technology.

- The next big moment came when I created my first AI chess game. Watching the pieces move across the board, controlled by logic I wrote, was both thrilling and empowering—it completely hooked me on programming.


### Hackathon Adventures 🏆

I’ve been diving into **hackathons** to test my skills and push my limits. One unforgettable hackathon stands out:  

- Worked **18 hours straight** just to qualify for the first round.  
- In the second round, I stayed focused, kept grinding, and **won the competition**.  
- The victory was so overwhelming, I actually cried—though I couldn’t quite explain why.  


### Tools and Tech 🛠️

I most work with following technologies but really love to wander off sometimes just for fun:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, C++  
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite , MongoDB
- **UI Libraries** Tailwind CSS , Shadcn 
- **Terminal:** Alacritty
- **Other Tools:** Docker, Git, Prisma, Vercel


> Currently I am working on a educational platform [code2tech](https://www.code2tech.net/) where we aim to create engaging and interactive learning experience for children with less exposure to tech and education.
